This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Ctrl+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}
av <- read.csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fivethirtyeight/data/master/avengers/avengers.csv", stringsAsFactors = FALSE)

library(tidyverse)
```

Grouping data

```{R}
?parse_number
Deaths <- av %>% gather(Death, died, Death1, Death2, Death3, Death4, Death5) 
Returns <- av %>% gather(Return, returned, Return1, Return2, Return3, Return4, Return5)

deathFreq <- Deaths %>% group_by(URL) %>% filter(died == "YES") %>% count(died)
av <- merge(av, deathFreq, by ="URL", all = TRUE)

returnFreq <- Returns %>% group_by(URL) %>% filter(returned == "YES") %>% count(returned)
av <- merge(av, returnFreq, by = "URL", all = TRUE)

colnames(av)[colnames(av) == 'died'] <- 'death'
colnames(av)[colnames(av) == 'n.x'] <- 'timesDied'
colnames(av)[colnames(av) == 'returned'] <- 'return'
colnames(av)[colnames(av) == 'n.y'] <- 'timesReturned'
```
Part 2 

The author claims that at least 69 avengers have died once

This code proves that that is the case: 

```{R}
av %>% filter(death == "YES") %>% count(death)
```
```{R}
av %>% filter(return == "YES") %>% count(return)
```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Ctrl+Alt+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Ctrl+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).
